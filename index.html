    <!-- I need to create a my battleship 1st -->
    <!-- Second I need to create an object for the alien battle ships, need to make 6 ships  -->


    <!-- you attack first -->
    <!-- game round looks like >> 
    1.you attack first 2.if the alien ship survives it attacks you. 3.If you survive , you attack the ship
4.if you destroy the ship, you havbe the option to "attack" the next ship or to "retreat"
 -->

 <!-- hull is hitpoints if you reach "0" the ship is destroyed -->
 <!-- firepower is the amount of damage done to the hull  -->
 <!-- accuracy is the chance between 0 and 1 that the ship will hit, use math.random() 
If the ship's accuracy is `0.8` - then if the number generated from `Math.random()` is less than or equal to `0.8` then the attack will be successful-->
<!--If the value is greater than `0.8` then the attack has missed  -->

<!-- USS Schwarzenegger** should have the following properties:
     * **hull** - `20` * **firepower** - `5` * **accuracy** - `.7` -->


<!-- The alien ships** should each have the following _ranged_ properties determined randomly
    :* hull - between `3` and `6` * firepower - between `2` and `4` * accuracy - between `.6` and 
    `.8` -->

 
    <!-- Example use of **accuracy** to determine a hit
: ```javascript if (Math.random() < alien[0].accuracy) { console.log('You have been hit!'); } ```    -->

<!-- <input type="text" name="" id="startgame" placeholder="this is the start of the game">     -->
<!-- <button  onclick="attackFunction()">Game Start</button> -->


<!-- game start button starts your attack on the alien ship -->
<!-- there needs to be an onclick command that starts a function for USS to attack the alien ,
game start function!!! -->

<!-- USS Schwarzenegger attacks an alien ship  -->
